+*vals-operator* syncs secrets from any secrets store supported by [vals](https://github.com/variantdev/vals) into Kubernetes. It works very similarly to [secrets-manager](https://github.com/tuenti/secrets-manager) and the code is actually based on it. Where they differ is that it not just supports HashiCorp Vault but many other secrets stores.
